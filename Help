Help Notes

Edit page: the current working edit page is edit2.php. To get to the edit screen, while on the main page put "admin" as the first
name, "pass" as the last name, and anything for the middle initial. The block of code that is controlling this is at the top
of pre1_form.php. Currently, the remove option must match the question EXACTLY. 

Survey notes: the survey is currently split into six pages with most pages having ten questions. There are currently 58 total
questions in the survey. When the next button is clicked at the bottom of the page, the data is sent to the next page. At the next
page the data from the previous page is checked to make sure all of the questions were answered, and if they were not the user gets
redirected to the previous page with a message stating they have not filled out all of the questions. The data is posted to the 
database in the pre_final_form.php and post_final_form.php files which run at the end of the survey, but the user never sees these 
pages.

Zend Framework: currently the survey does not run off of zend framework, but a base has been laid out if you with to use. These
files can be found in a separate branch.
